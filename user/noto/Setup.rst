Antenna overall setup
=====================

When opening an ESCS observing session, it is necessary to perform a setup 
which includes the antenna unstow, the mount configuration in tracking mode, 
the minor servo setup. This is done by means of a unique command, which is 
specific for the wanted receiver, to be written in the **operatorInput**. 
The currently available choices are::

    > setupSXP     for the SX-band receiver
    > setupCCC     for the C-band receiver 
    > setupMMC     for the M-band receiver
    > setupKKC     for the K-band receiver
    > setupQQC     for the Q-band receiver

.. admonition:: WARNING:  

    * It is necessary to manually select the observing focus using the hardware 
      IF switch located in the control room. The figure below illustrates this
      rack.

The general setup command sets the antenna mount, the minor servos, the selected 
receiver and the default backend (TotalPower) according to **default 
parameters**. The antenna mode is set to **ProgramTrack** (allowing tracking 
and the execution of schedules), while the Local Oscillator frequency and the 
bandwidth are set as illustrated in the following table.

Notice that the true observed band depends on the **intersection between the 
frontend IF band and the chosen backend filter**. The actual observed 
bandwidth and the band starting frequency are recorded in the output files 
(see :ref:`EN_Appendix-C-Output-files`).

(1) For this setup, the FITS file will **NOT** report the actual values 
relative to frequency and bandwidth, as the present ESCS release does not take 
into account the different conversion taking place for this receiver. 
  

Logfile
=======

The default logfile is named **station.log**. 
If the user wants to change it::

    > log=[logfilename]  (without extension)

Logfiles are stored in a dedicated folder (see Retrieving the data).
**When schedules are run, a new logfile is automatically started**, and it is 
named after the schedule: [schedulename].log.
