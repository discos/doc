This is the **input console** where users write Nuraghe commands. The prompt is just a sequential number enclosed in <>. If a command is properly read, the system replies repeating the command itself, followed by the operation results (if they are foreseen). Otherwise, an error message appears. To close the window, type ‘exit’. 

AntennaBoss
===========

   :scale: 100%
   :alt: AntennaBoss
   :align: center

This monitor shows the commanded and actual positions. It also gives a feedback on the pointing accuracy and on the overall antenna status. Parameters:   * **Target**: label (as extracted from schedule),     coordinates (RAJ2000.0, DecJ2000.0),     VLSR (km/s, if available), estimated flux     density (Jy, if available).  * **Horiz. Offs**: Horizontal (Az-El) offsets as     read from schedule, degrees.    * **Equat. Offs**: Equatorial (RA-Dec) offsets     as read from schedule, degrees.   * **Galac. Offs**: Galactic (l-b) offsets as read     from schedule, degrees.   * **Raw Horizontal**: commanded Az-El,     including pointing model, refraction, etc...   * **Observed Horizontal**: Az-El coordinates read from the mount encoders and cleaned 
    from the pointing model and refraction contributions. 
    Because of this, observed coordinates will differ from the raw ones. 

  * **Observed Equatorial**: RA-Dec J2000.0 coordinates, converted from the observed horizontal.   * **Observed Galactic**: l-b Galactic coordinates, converted from the observed horizontal.   * **Generator Type**: which component is in charge of the generation of the coordinates. 
    It can be NONE (which is the condition at startup), OTF, MOON or SIDEREAL.   * **Corr. az/el/ref**: azimuth and elevation corrections (degrees) applied by the pointing model, 
    plus the refraction model contribution– which is an additional correction to elevation.   * **FWHM**: Full Width Half Maximum (corresponding to HPBW), degrees.   * **Enabled**: a green “@” indicates that the antenna is correctly receiving commands; 
    a red “o” means the communication is disabled.   * **Tracking**: it indicates whether the pointing error exceeds 0.1*FWHM or not. 
    A green “@” corresponds to error < 0.1*FWMH. It should turn to a red “o” only 
    when the antenna is slewing between scans on the same source, or when slewing to/from a new source.   * **Correction**: application of the above horizontal coordinates corrections. 
    If disabled (red circle), all corrections are zeroed.   * **Status**: OK, WARNING or ERROR. “Warning” needs investigation but usually 
    does not stop the ongoing activity (it also appears at startup, before the 
    setup commands), “Error” generally appears if something stops the observations.   * **Generator**: under this line all the subscan setup parameters appear when it is commanded.
    See the two cases here below. 
In particular, for **OTF observations**: 
|	*Start-Center-Stop* – coordinates in the subscan frame of the start, 
|                           center and stop positions (degrees)|	*StartTime-Dur.* – subscan start UT (yyyy-doy-hh:mm:ss.s) and duration (hh:mm:ss.s)|	*J2000-Apparent eq* – during the subscan, current RA-Dec position pointed by the antenna, |                           both in the J2000 epoch and precessed to the date. Format is 
|                           hh:mm:ss.s-°°:’ ’:” ”.”|	*Horizontal* - during the subscan, current Az-El position pointed by the antenna (degrees)|	*Galactic* - during the subscan, current l-b position pointed by the antenna (degrees)|       *Sky/Phi rate* – actual subscan speed on sky along scanning direction (°/s). 
|                       The ‘Phi rate’ value refers to great circle arcs, if it is the scanning 
|                       geometry, otherwise it copies the first speed value. 
.For **SIDEREAL scans**, instead, this is what appears:|       *Source name* – target name|	*Catalog Eq.* – target FK5 coordinates and info (if available): 
|                     RA hh:mm:ss.s, Dec °:’:”.”, Epoch, RA proper motion (milliarcsec per julian year), 
|                     Dec proper motion (milliarcsec per julian year), parallax (milliarcsec), 
|                     radial velocity (km/s)|	*Catalog Gal.* – target Galactic longitude and latitude (degrees) converted from 
|                     the above Equatorial or provided by user/catalogue|	*Apparent Eq.* – target current apparent Equatorial coordinates: RA hh:mm:ss.s, Dec °:’:”.”, Epoch   |	*Galactic* – current l-b position pointed by the antenna (degrees)|       *Horizontal* –current Az-El position pointed by the antenna (degrees)
.

    for the telescope, plus the geodetic model code.   * **Geocentric Coords**: geocentric cartesian coordinates (m) for the telescope.To close the monitor, type ‘exit’ in its prompt (the grey line). 


Mount
=====

.. figure:: images/Screenshot-Mount.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Mount
   :align: center

This is a quite complex frame, allowing the technical staff to monitor all the various parts of the antenna mount. Observers must focus only on a subset of the displayed parameters and flags. We thus describe the main features only. The top left section gives the online readouts for the Azimuth and Elevation axes, compared to the commanded positions. Line by line:  * **Azimuth**: current azimuth position (in the -90°/450° wrapping range), rate (°/s) 
    and commanded offset (degrees). Then the measured position error and tracking error 
    (both in degrees) are given. Finally, the axis active mode is displayed: it can 
    be PRESET (fixed Az-El pointing only), PROGRAMTRACK (for tracking, OTF and schedules), 
    STOP (if axes brakes are on), UNKNOWN (indicating a non-configured status).  * **Cmd Az.**: commanded azimuth position (in the -90°/450° wrapping range), rate (°/s) 
    and offset (°). This offset comes from metrology devices, it is not related to user-defined 
    offsets or subscan-defined offsets. 
  * **Elevation**: current elevation position (degrees), rate (°/s) and commanded offset 
    (degrees). Then the measured position error and tracking error (both in degrees) are given. 
    Finally, the axis active mode is displayed: it can be PRESET (fixed Az-El pointing), 
    PROGRAMTRACK	(for OTF and schedules), STOP (if axes brakes are on), UNKNOWN (usually 
    indicating an error condition).  * **Cmd El.**: commanded elevation position (degrees) and rate (°/s).   * **Wrap**: readouts from the cable wrap. The status flag on the right can be CW or CCW. The general condition of the mount is summed up by one keyword, in the central part:  * **Mount status**: it can be OK, WARNING, FAILURE or BUSY, the latter is associated 
    to operations which take a lot of time to complete (as the stow-unstow procedure). 
    When the mount is BUSY it will not accept further commands until the ongoing 
    operation is completed.  The rest of the panel lists several **flags and status labels**. For average users, the only points to be taken into account are:
    * in standard observing conditions, when a schedule runs, all flags should be green “o”;    * in case of warnings, flags turn to yellow “o”;    * errors correspond to red “o”;    * when a “failure” keyword turns steadily to a red “o”, or a permanent failure status appears, 
      immediately call for technical assistance. To close the monitor, type ‘exit’ in its prompt (the grey line). 



GenericBackend
==============

.. figure:: images/Screenshot-GenericBackend.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: GenericBackend
   :align: center

The panel shows one row for every section.   * **Freq**: value (MHz) to be added to the LO frequency in order to obtain 
    the observed frequency at the beginning of the band  * **BW**: bandwidth (MHz)   * **Feed**: number of the receiver feed connected to this section
  * **S.R.**: sampling rate (MHz) 
  * **Pol**: polarisation (Left or Right)   * **Bins**: number of frequency bins (1 for total power)   * **DBs**: attenuation (dB) applied to the section 
  * **Sect**: section number   * **Tsys**: the last measured Tsys (K)Also some backend-dependent status flags are present, in the top right area. When observing with the TPB, look for:
  * **Time_Sync**: if it frequently or steadily turns red call for 
    assistance (the backend time is not synchronized)  * **Busy**: when schedules are running, it must turn yellow. 
    If it does not, the backend is not acquiring.To close the monitor, type ‘exit’ in its prompt (the grey line). 

ReceiversBoss
=============

.. figure:: images/Screenshot-Receivers.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: ReceiversBoss
   :align: left

This monitor summarizes the frontend setup.   * **Current setup**: receiver code.  * **Mode**: NORMAL, SINGLEDISH, VLBI… (other codes to come).   * **Status**: OK, WARNING or FAILURE  * **Feeds**: number of feeds (1 fore single-feed receivers, 7 for the K-band MF)  * **LO**: Local Oscillator frequency (MHz)  
  * **Start Freq.**: step (MHz) to be added to the LO frequency in order to 
    obtain the actually observed frequency at the beginning of the band  * **Bandwidth**: actually observed bandwidth (MHz)  * **Polarisation**: LCP, RCP, HLP or VLP.To close the monitor, type ‘exit’ in its prompt (the grey line). 


Scheduler
=========

.. figure:: images/SchedulerTui.jpg
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Scheduler
   :align: left

This monitor shows details on the selected data acquisition devices and on the running schedule, if any.  * **Project code**: project name, as specified at the launch of 
    the schedule (or as input using the project= command)  * **Schedule**: name of the active schedule  * **Scan/Subscan**: scan number and subscan number, relative to the ongoing acquisition  * **Backend**: name of the selected backend, as listed in the schedule  * **Recorder**: name of the selected data recording device, as listed in the schedule  * **Device**: number of the currently selected device (see device= command)  * **Tracking**: tracking status of the telescope, including antenna, 
    active surface, minor servo. A red “o” means the telescope is not 
    yet in its tracking route (or that it is not tracking properly), 
    a green light means the observation is ongoing and the tracking is 
    accurate within 0.1*HPBW  * **Status**: flag summarising the telescope status. OK is sel-explanatory, 
    WARNING in principle indicates that the acquisition can go on even if a 
    problem has been reported, ERROR signals that a major problem was detected 
    and the observation cannot be performed.  

To close the monitor, type ‘exit’ in its prompt (the grey line). 


MinorServo
==========

   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Scheduler
   :align: left

This monitor shows details on the Minor Servo systems:

  * **Current setup**: the actual setup code (CCB, KKG, KKG_ASACTIVE, …)
  * **Ready**: when green, the receiver is in its working position...)  * **Starting** : when green, the minor servo are moving in order to put 
    the selected receiver in its working position  * **AS Conf**: when green, the subreflector position is computed by assuming 
    the primary mirror surface is shaped and active (it is changing 
    with the antenna elavation)  * **Elevation Track**: when green, the subreflector is changing its 
    position with the elevation  * **Scan active**: when green, a scan is active. That means either the system 
    is performing a scan or a scan is terminated and so the system is waiting 
    for a stopScan command or for a new scan   * **Scanning**: when green, the system is performing a scanTo close the monitor, type ‘exit’ in its prompt (the grey line). .. note:: All the monitors can be closed at a time using the command (in a terminal on OBS1)::	$ nuragheConsole --stop
