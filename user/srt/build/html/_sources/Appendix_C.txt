Appendix C - Output files
*************************

The system at present allows the user to write the output data, coming from the integrated backends, in two different formats: FITS and MBFITS. The former is a substantially **standard FITS**, carrying the data and a load of ancillary information inside several extensions. A FITS is produced for every subscan composing the observation.
**MBFITS is a more complex format, not yet implemented for the SRT** as the relative writer component is still under testing. Each MBFITS contains the whole scan, and subscans are hierarchically organized inside its structure.
**Details on both formats are provided in a separate manual.**
