Antenna overall setup
=====================

When opening a Nuraghe observing session, it is necessary to perform a setup which includes the antenna unstow, the mount configuration in tracking mode, the minor servo setup. This is done by means of a unique command, which is specific for the wanted receiver, to be written in the **operatorInput**. The currently available choices are::	> setupLLP	for the L band receiver (Primary focus)	> setupPPP	for the P band receiver (Primary focus)	> setupCCB	for the C band receiver (BWG focus)	> setupKKG	for the K band receiver (Gregorian focus)
.. note:: Spaces within the command line content are **not** allowed!The above setup command sets the antenna mount, the minor servos, the selected receiver and the default backend (TotalPower) according to **default parameters**. The antenna mode is set to **ProgramTrack** (allowing tracking and the execution of schedules), while the Local Oscillator frequency and the bandwidth are set as illustrated in the following table.

.. [1] Virtual value: there is no LO for this receiver
.. [2] Still subject to variations

Notice that, depending on the devices in use, the sky frequency at the observed band starting point is given by the LO frequency plus an offset. For the present combinations of the frontends *with the total power backend*, which the above table refers to, this offset is 100 MHz. In general, the true observed band depends on the **intersection between the frontend IF band and the chosen backend filter**. The actual observed bandwidth and the band starting frequency are recorded in the output files (see Appendix C – Output files).


Active Surface setup
====================

After the initial setup, to configure and enable the active surface (AS) give the following commands in the operatorInput panel::	> asSetup=[code]   where \[code\] is:* **SF** shaped configuration in fixed position (optimised for El=45°)* **S**  shaped configuration in tracking – i.e. it adjusts according to the observed  elevation position* **PF** parabolic configuration in fixed position (optimised for El=45°)* **P**  parabolic configuration in tracking – i.e. it adjusts according to the observed elevation position


Minor Servo configuration
=========================

When using the Gregorian or BWG focus only, the minor servo must be configured. The MS system configuration requires to specify whether the AS is in use. If it is, give the following command in the operatorInput::	> setServoASConfiguration=ON It is then necessary to set the MS in tracking mode, so that the subreflector adjusts its position according to its pointing model::	> setServoElevationTracking=ON


Logfile and project code
========================

The default logfile is named **station.log**. If the user wants to change it::	> log=[logfilename] (without extension)Logfiles are stored in a dedicated folder (see Retrieving the data).**When schedules are run, a new logfile is automatically started**, and it is named after the schedule: [schedulename].log.It is possible, and advisable, to insert the project code/name (a string assigned to the project by the TAC) using the command::	> project=[projectcode]   (e.g. project=scicom)      This will make the user save time in later stages, as it will not be necessary to specify the project name in schedule-launching commands. The project code/name must correspond to an existing user, already known to the system. This means that, if its spelling does not match with the recorded name, an error rises.
