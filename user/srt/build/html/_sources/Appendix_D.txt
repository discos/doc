Appendix D - Source catalogue
*****************************

Here follow the sources which are listed in the system catalogue. Their names, as presented here, can be used in schedules (SIDEREAL subscans, inside the LIS file) or in the command:: 	> track=[sourcename] Along with their J2000 Equatorial coordinates, the catalogue records usually contain further information such as apparent size, proper motion, radial velocity, coefficients of the *Ott et al.* polynomials describing the spectra, etc… Nuraghe uses these parameters to make computations during certain operations (e.g. when calibration tools are used – under development, they will be described in future releases of this manual):
