Generating and launching a schedule 
***********************************

A schedule is a set of files where all the geometry/timing/frequency details of a sequence of data acquisitions are specified, according to a syntax that enables Nuraghe to read and execute them. The detailed structure of the several files composing a schedule is explained in a separate guide. Schedules for the most common observing modes (OTF cross-scans and maps, raster maps and ON-OFF) can be easily generated using a tool called **schedulecreator**.  At present, though, schedulecreator allows the production of *continuum schedules only* (see its documentation for details) and Nuraghe does not provide any automation in the doppler computation required in order to observe a given spectral line. This means that continuum-style schedules can be exploited, as far as users take care in properly setting the frontend LO value and the spectrometer frequency and bandwidth configuration.   Once a schedule is ready, it must be copied to the folder reserved to the project.There, the schedule formal consistency can be tested using the scheduleChecker command given within a terminal (*not* in the operatorInput)::	> scheduleChecker [schedname].scd Only the syntax correctness will be verified. If errors are present, a reply will briefly address them indicating their position inside the files.  To launch a schedule, simply use:: 	> startSchedule=[project/][schedname].scd,[N]“project” is the unique string assigned to every project. It can be omitted if the project command had been used. If both the choices are made, i.e. if the project name was set with project but a string is also inserted in the startSchedule command, the latter overrides the former.  Then follows the schedule name, in particular the name of the SCD file. *“N”* is the identifier of the scan or subscan from which Nuraghe must start reading it – it is particularly useful in case of a sequential (i.e. not time-based) schedule. *“N”* can be the scan number, e.g. 2, or the scan_subscan specification, e.g. 2_5. You can specify **when to start** the schedule (in UT)::	> startSchedule=[project/][schedname].scd,[N]@[DOY-HH:MM:SS]Nuraghe reads the configuration parameters from the schedule, which can be relative both to the receiver and the backend, and accordingly sets these devices. This might take several seconds, especially when using the MF receiver. While the setup takes place, several values change in the TPB monitor.The last operation is the upload of the first pointing/scan read from the schedule, whose parameters will show up in the bottom section of the AntennaBoss monitor.During the scans, all the three flags in the lower part of the AntennaBoss monitor must be a green “@”. Pay attention to the “Tracking” one. It should turn to a red “o” only when the antenna is slewing between scans on the same source, or when slewing to/from a new source. **If tracking is not correct for some consecutive seconds during a scan, something is wrong.**Sequential schedules run ad libitum. To abruptly interrupt the running schedule, truncating the ongoing acquisition::	> stopScheduleInstead, to stop the schedule allowing the completion of the present file::	> haltSchedule
