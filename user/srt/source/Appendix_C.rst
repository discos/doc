Appendix C - Output files
*************************

The system at present allows the user to write the output data, coming from the 
integrated backends, in a substantially standard FITS format, carrying the data and a load 
of ancillary information inside several extensions. A FITS is produced for 
every subscan composing the observation.

**Details on this format are provided in this separate manual**
