.. describe:: Fault reporting:

When filing an issue, make sure to answer the following questions:

* What version of DISCOS are you referring? Which telescope are you at?
* What did you do?
* What did you expect to see?
* What did you see instead?

.. describe:: Feature requests:

If you find yourself wishing for a feature or enhancement that doesn't exist, you are probably not alone. 
Open an issue which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
