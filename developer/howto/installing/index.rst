.. topic:: Abstract

   This howto describes how to deploy DISCOS.  Even though the whole
   process is automatic and hides the underline technologies, before
   starting you have to spend 15 minutes to install four dependencies:
   `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, `Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_,
   `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ and `VirtualBox
   <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_.  Look at section :ref:`dependencies`
   to see how to install them, afterwards read the :ref:`deployment_quickstart`.
