***********
Quick start
***********

If you have installed the dependencies, as explained in section
:ref:`dependencies`, then you are ready to download the
`DISCOS deployment repository <https://github.com/discos/deployment.git>`_:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ git clone git@github.com:discos/deployment.git
   Cloning into 'deployment'...

.. note:: In order to be able to provision the system correctly, authentication
   to GitHub requires the use of a `SSH key <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/>`_.


Before installing the package, you have to install some additional Python requirements.
Move inside the `deployment` directory and type the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ cd deployment
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt


.. note:: The last executed command will also install the most important tool on which
   the whole package relies: it is called `Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_.
   Ansible is a very powerful tool, able to perform a machine configuration
   applying a series of pre-defined tasks. It can also work in parallel when you
   need to configure multiple machines.


Now you are ready to install the package. The recommended way to do so is to
install it inside a Python custom environment. In order to do so, type the
following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ python setup.py install


If you want to install the package inside the system Python environment instead,
you have to execute the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ python setup.py install --user
   $ source ~/.bashrc  # Refresh the shell environment


Now that the package setup procedure is completed, you are ready to start deploying a
DISCOS environment. In order to do so, keep reading the guide below.


Provision the system
====================
The provisioning procedure is entirely handled by the :file:`discos-deploy`
script, that has been installed in your system in the previous step.
Below you can find an explanation of how the script works, along with some
command line examples that show you how to deploy the DISCOS environment you want.
For instance, the following command will create the ``manager`` virtual machine,
and will install all dependencies and configuration files on it:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ discos-deploy manager:development

In this case we gave the :file:`discos-deploy` script the
``manager:development`` argument.  It means we want to deploy only the
``manager`` machine, in the ``development`` environment.  We will see more
about the environments in sections :ref:`deploy_development` and
:ref:`deploy_production`.

The deployment of a single machine takes about one hour, it has to download and
install the operating system, all the dependencies (ACS, DISCOS libraries, etc.),
create users and groups, configure the network, and create a complete working
environment, as we will see in a few moments.


.. note:: You can run the deployment more than once, because the process is
   idempotent, that is, the result of performing the deployment once is
   exactly the same as the result of performing it repeatedly without any
   intervening actions. In fact, if you run the deployment process once again,
   it will take just a few minutes.

When the deployment procedure is complete, we will have the ``manager``
virtual machine deployed with everything we need.


.. _get_a_discos_branch:

Get a DISCOS branch
===================
Login via SSH to ``manager`` machine (or use the :file:`discos-login` script
described in the :ref:`deploy_scripts` section):

.. code-block:: shell

    $ ssh discos@<manager IP address>
    (branch?) discos@manager ~ $

Currently we have no active branch, that is why there is the ``(branch?)`` text
at the beginning of the prompt. To get a DISCOS branch and activate it, we have
to use the ``discos-get`` command. In the following case we get the ``master``
branch for the ``SRT`` station:


.. figure:: images/discos-get.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :align: center


Note that this is not a *code-block*, but a screenshot of the shell.
As you can see the environment shows the prompt using a syntax highlight. The
``branch?`` text has been replaced by ``master-srt:telescope``, because we are
working on the branch ``master``, using its ``telescope`` CDB, which is the
actual production CDB, hosted into ``SRT/Configuration``. The ``INTROOT`` has
been created outside the ``discos`` user home directory, in order to enable
access to it to a generic ``observer`` user, and it shares the same name as the
downloaded branch. Also, you may have noticed that the ``discos-get`` command
accepts a ``--station`` argument. This argument is required on development
machines, since they are generic and do not completely reflect the behavior of
a production machine. In case of production machines, the ``--station``
argument is disabled since the station is already specified by the system
itself. This was made in order to avoid using a different station configuration
database. Here is the current environment:

.. figure:: images/environment.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :align: center


Change the CDB
==============
The ``discos-set`` command allows us to specifying the CDB.
We can choose either ``--cdb telescope`` or ``--cdb test``:

.. figure:: images/cdb.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :align: center


Change the active branch
========================
Sometime we want to have more than one branch and switch between them.
For instance, let's get the ``stable`` branch for ``Medicina`` station:

.. figure:: images/medicina.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :align: center

Now we have two branches, ``master-srt`` and ``stable-medicina``, and the
latter is the active one. We can switch back to the ``master`` branch using the
``discos-set`` command:

.. figure:: images/discos-set.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :align: center


Remove a branch
===============
To remove a branch, just remove the directory:

.. figure:: images/remove-branch.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :align: center

The related ``INTROOT`` will be deleted automatically right after the branch
directory is removed.


.. _install_discos:

Install DISCOS
==============
To install the DISCOS control system, execute the commands shown in the image
below:

.. figure:: images/make.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :align: center

.. note:: The output of the ``make`` and ``make install`` commands shown above
   was suppressed. The whole building and installation process can take up to
   one hour or more, depending on your system.


What we have seen so far is enough for deploying a small development
environment, but there is more to know.  Maybe you want to deploy the whole
system, composed of several VMs, or maybe you want to deploy the system on
production machines. For more information about these topics have a look at
the :ref:`deploy_development` and :ref:`deploy_production` sections. You will
realize that everything is as easy as we saw here, and for deploying in
production is even easier.
