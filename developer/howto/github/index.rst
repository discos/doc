Github HOWTO
############

.. topic:: Abstract

    This section is a quick newbie guide that shows how to configure a new user to interact with the 
    DISCOS software repository hosted on github.com. We will also show how
    to clone the repository and making changes in a new branch and merge it into
    the master development branch via a pull request.
    Finally we describe in detail the GitHub based workflow we decided to adopt during development and maintenance.     
		
		
	 **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Our complete step-by-step development flow for both new features and bug fixing is
	 reported in :ref:`workflow`
