.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbuttu`

The goal of this document is to explain the steps you have to follow
if you want to integrate a device (a backend, a receiver, etc.) in Nuraghe. 
It is really easy, just follow this two steps:

* contact the :ref:`project manager <project-manager>` in order to plan the 
  component development
* from your side, implement the :ref:`protocol <protocols>` related 
  to your device

That's all.
