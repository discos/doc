.. topic:: Abstract

   This section lists some of the protocols we use to communicate to
   the hardware. If you want to integrate a device in DISCOS (a backend,
   a receiver, etc.), you should read this document in order to find for
   for a protocol to choice. If either your device is not listen 
   in this document or for technical reasons your hardware does not suit
   the protocols listed here, then please do not go ahead on your own 
   initiative but please, contact the :ref:`project-manager` or the
   :ref:`core-dev`.
