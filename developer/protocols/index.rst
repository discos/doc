.. topic:: Abstract

   This section lists some of the protocols we use to communicate to
   the hardware. If you want to integrate a device in Nuraghe (a backend,
   a receiver, etc.), you should look at this document in order to find
   the protocol related to your device. If either your device is not listen 
   in this document or for technical reasons your hardware does not suit
   the protocols listed here, then please do not go ahead on your own 
   initiative but please, contact the :ref:`team`.
