NURAGHE 0.5
===========
Nuraghe-0.5-RC (Release Candidate) will be released on Monday
22 June 2015. The release date of the stable version depends on the
astronomer feedback, as explained in :ref:`Release Candidate <rc>`, so
it is not yet decided.


New features
------------

Dewar positioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :ref:`DewarPositioner` component is in charge of compensating the field
rotation when dealing with  multi-pixel receivers (if equipped with a 
derotation system). Details on supported modes,
configurations and more precise information required when dealing with
the derotation system are available :ref:`here <DewarPositioner>`.

   :ref:`srighini`


K band derotator control  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The derotation system installed with the K band receiever is now completely
under control.  

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbuttu`


Frequency tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to fulfill the requirements for spectroscopy observations, the system
can now keep a requested rest frequency in centre of the band of the backend 
(section). Both frontend and backend local oscillator could be tuned during
this operation. This capability is now supported from both command line and
schedule.

System changes
-------------- 

Continuous calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some backends can quickly switch the calibration diode on and off 
(Total Power, DFB). Up to now this capability had to be enabled in the frontend
control boards. From now on the operation is fully automated and does not require
the human intervention any more.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbuttu`, :ref:`aorlati`


FitsZilla fits file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some keywords added (mainly belonging to spectroscopy). In the output scan
folder, when the scan is closed a *summary.fits* is created. The file contains
just the main header with some keywords describing the current scan.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`aorlati`, :ref:`srighini`


Minor servo system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Coming from a setup the minor servo system (subreflector) will be now 
*tracking as the active surface is on*. That means the system setup 
automatically issues the commands:

.. code-block:: discos

    > setServoElevationTracking=ON
    > setServoASConfiguration=ON

so they are not required any more. 
The user is asked to issue the correct configuration in case other 
behaviours are required.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbuttu`


User interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Minor changes to existing panels. Some parameters from the telescope, mainly
from the new features are now monitored.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbuttu`, :ref:`aorlati` 


logging
~~~~~~~
The user commands from operator console are now logged. Logging system is now
more robust. The management of the system log file is now more crafty,
avoiding the creation of bigger log files.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbartolini`, :ref:`afara`


Xarcos
~~~~~~
Fully supported and integrated in the system. Integration time is now in
milliseconds.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`cmigoni`, :ref:`amelis`

Schedules
~~~~~~~~~
The schedule now allows to call parametric configuration procedures.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbartolini`, :ref:`aorlati`

Testing Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The development framework now integrates tools for automatic tests development
and execution.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbartolini`

Build automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The build process has been reorganized in order to have nightly builds and 
build status reports
