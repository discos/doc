===========

The RC (Release Candidate) release date is 22/06/2015
The release date of the stable version is not yet decided

New features
------------

Dewar positioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *DewarPositioner* component is in charge of compensating the field
rotation when dealing with  multi-pixel receivers (if equipped with a 
derotation system). Details on supported modes,
configurations and more precice information required when dealing with
derotation system are here: :ref: `DewarPositioner`

K band derotator control  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The derotation system installed with the K band receiever is now completely
under control.  

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbuttu`


Frequency tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to fullfil the requirements for spectroscopy observations, the system
can now keep a requested rest frequency in centre of the band of the backend 
(section). Both frontend and backend local oscillator could be tuned during
this operation. Ths capability is now supported from both command line and
schedule.

System changes
-------------- 

Continuos calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some backends can quickly switch the calibration diode on and off 
(Total Power, DFB). Up to now this capability had to  enabled in the frontend
control boards. Now the operation is fully auotmatized and does not require
human intervantion any more.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbuttu`, :ref:`aorlati`

FitsZilla fits file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some keywords added (mainly belonging to spectroscopy). In the output scan
folder, when the scan is closed a *summary.fits* is created. The file contains
just the main header with some keywords describing the current scan.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`aorlati`, :ref:`srighini`

Minor servo system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Coming from a setup the minor servo system (subreflector) will be now "tracking
as the active surface is on". To get this configuration, user commands are 
then not required any more. The user is asked to issue the correct
configuration in case  other behviours are required.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbuttu`

User interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minor changes to existing panels. Some parameters from the teelscope, mainly
from the new features are now monitored.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbuttu`, :ref:`aorlati` 

logging
~~~~~~~

The user commands from operator console are now logged. Logging system is now
more robust. The management of the system log file is now more crafty,
avoiding the creation of bigger log files

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbartolini`, :ref:`afara`

Xarcos
~~~~~~

Fully supported and integrated in the system. Integration time is now in
milliseconds.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`cmigoni`, :ref:`amelis`

Schedules
~~~~~~~~~

The schedule now allows to call parametric configuration procedures.
