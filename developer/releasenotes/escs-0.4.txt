ESCS 0.4
===========
ESCS 0.4 was released March the 24th, 2016. 
The previuos version was released on October 2012 so this release contains lots of new updates and improvements coming from 3 years and a half of developments mainly driven by SRT requirements.

New features
------------

Frequency tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to fulfill the requirements for spectroscopy observations, the system
can now keep a requested rest frequency in centre of the band of the backend 
(section). Both frontend and backend local oscillator could be tuned during
this operation. This capability is now supported from both command line and
schedule.

Continuous calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TotalPower backend can quickly switch the calibration diode on and off 
(Total Power). This capabilities can also be exposed to other backends (DBBC) after a proper configuration. THis is now fully under software control.

Xarcos
~~~~~~
Fully supported and integrated in the system. Integration time is now in
milliseconds.

System changes
-------------- 

FitsZilla fits file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some keywords added (mainly belonging to spectroscopy). In the output scan
folder, when the scan is closed a *summary.fits* is created. The file contains
just the main header with some keywords describing the current scan.
The "signal" keyword was added to the main header. Presently, three possible 
values are available:

.. code-block:: discos

    * SIGNAL #indicating that the subscan was performed on-source
    * REFERENCE # indicating the telescope was off-source during the subscan
    * NONE # meaning the the keyword is unknown or the keyword is not pertinet 
             to the current subscan

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`aorlati`, :ref:`srighini`

Alias name for fully integrated backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The command *chooseBackend* now allows the use of aliases for backends. 
Standard names continue to work regularly.
The mnemonic names or aliases are the following:

=================== ============
Standard name       Alias
=================== ============
BACKENDS/TotalPower TotalPower
BACKENDS/XBackends  XArcos
=================== ============
 
.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`aorlati`.

User interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The console will now present an additional panel (genericBackend) that shows the current configuration and status of XArcos.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`aorlati` 

Manual Recording
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user now could manage a recording from the currently selected backend to the defualt data writer(see commands *chooseBackend* and *chooseRecorder*).
Three new commands are now availble from the operatorInput:

.. code-block:: discos

	> initRecording : prepares the data recording
	> startRecording: starts the recording and file creation
	> terminateScan: closes the scan


.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`aorlati` 

Logging
~~~~~~~
The user commands from operator console are now logged. Logging system is now
more robust. The management of the system log file is now more crafty,
avoiding the creation of bigger log files. System log files are daily rotated
and stored for 1 year.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbartolini`, :ref:`afara`

Schedules
~~~~~~~~~
The schedule now allows to call parametric configuration procedures.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbartolini`, :ref:`aorlati`

Testing Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The development framework now integrates tools for automatic tests development
and execution.

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbartolini`

Build automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The build process has been reorganized in order to have nightly builds and 
build status reports
