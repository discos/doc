New features
------------

Local Oscillator for the LP-band receiver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now the ``LPBandReceiver`` component can set the local oscillator, so
the component behaves as the other receivers, and it is possible to use 
the ``setLO`` command from the operator input console:

.. code-block:: discos

    > receiversSetup=LLP
    > setLO=2300

This new feature is only available using the L band feed (it is not 
possible to set the local oscillator in the ``PPP`` configuration). 

It is not allowed to set the LO inside the observed sky band. For instance:

.. code-block:: discos

    > receiversMode=XXL5 # Bandwidth 1625:1715
    > setLO=1650
    Error - Value not allowed. It is within the band...

It is also not possible to set a receiver mode in case the current LO value 
is inside the mode band:

.. code-block:: discos

    > receiversMode=XXL5 # Bandwidth 1625:1715
    > setLO=1500 # Ok, it is outside the RF band
    > receiversMode=XXL4 # Bandwidth 1300:1800
    Error - Mode not allowed. The LO value is within the band...

A 1000MHz low pass filter is applyed to the IFs, so it is not possible to 
set a LO value that puts the IFs over the low pass filter:

.. code-block:: discos

    > receiversMode=XXL4 # Band 1300:1800
    > setLO=200 # IF band: 1100:1600
    Error - Value not allowed. The IF bandwidth is outside the low pass filter.
