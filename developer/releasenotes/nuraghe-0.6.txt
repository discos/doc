Local Oscillator for the LP-band receiver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now the ``LPBandReceiver`` component can set the local oscillator, so
the component behaves as the other receivers, and it is possible to use 
the ``setLO`` command from the operator input console:

.. code-block:: discos

    > receiversSetup=LLP
    > setLO=2300

This new feature is only available using the L band feed (it is not 
possible to set the local oscillator in the ``PPP`` configuration). 

It is not allowed to set the LO inside the observed sky band. For instance:

.. code-block:: discos

    > receiversMode=XXL5 # Bandwidth 1625:1715
    > setLO=1650
    Error - Value not allowed. It is within the band...

It is also not possible to set a receiver mode in case the current LO value 
is inside the mode band:

.. code-block:: discos

    > receiversMode=XXL5 # Bandwidth 1625:1715
    > setLO=1500 # Ok, it is outside the RF band
    > receiversMode=XXL4 # Bandwidth 1300:1800
    Error - Mode not allowed. The LO value is within the band...

The bandwith value is always positive, while the IFs could be negative,
indicating that the IF band is inverted. For instance, in the following case:

.. code-block:: discos

    > receiversMode=XXL5 # Bandwidth 1625:1715
    > setLO=2300

the receiver panel will show ``startFreq=-675`` and ``bandwidth=90``. 

A 1000MHz low pass filter is applyed to the IFs, so it is not possible to 
set a LO value that puts the IFs over the low pass filter:

.. code-block:: discos

    > receiversMode=XXL4 # Band 1300:1800
    > setLO=200 # IF band: 1100:1600
    Error - Value not allowed. The IF bandwidth is outside the low pass filter.

System changes
-------------- 

FitsZilla fits file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A keyword "signal" has been added to the mian header. Presently three possible values are avilable:

.. code-block:: discos

    * SIGNAL #indicating that the subscan has been done on source
    * REFERENCE # indicating the telescope was off source during the subscan
    * NONE # meaning the the keyword is unknown or the keyword is not pertinet 
             for the current subscan

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`aorlati`, :ref:`srighini`

Alias name for fully integrated backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The command *chooseBackend* now allows the use of aliases for backends. Standard names continue to work regularly.
The mnemonic names or aliases are the following:

=================== ============
Standard name       Alias
=================== ============
BACKENDS/TotalPower TotalPower
BACKENDS/XBackends  XArcos
BACKENDS/Roach      Roach	
=================== ============
 
.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`aorlati`.

Continuos calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to control the calibration mark from an external source (i.e. backends like the DFB or DBBC) the Total Power backend (focus selector) 
should be configured accordingly. Also the frontend requires an identical configuration, this part has been addressed in previous release 
(see command *externalCalOn*).
The command *calSwitch*, when the Total Power is the current backend, has been slightly modified. It now allows for the following sintax :

.. code-block:: discos

    > calSwitch=N # where N is a integer value. One sample every N is acquired with the noise cal turned on. This is the old behaviour of  the Total Power. It also disable the configuration EXT
    > calSwitch=OFF # turns off all the previous setup and disable the calibration mark control through the Total Power backend
    > calSwitch=EXT # the mark will be controlled from external sources (DBBC, DFB .....)

.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`aorlati`.

User Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The backend panel associated to the Total Power backend shows an extended status word. Four bits have been added:

.. code-block:: discos

    * ExternalMark # it turns yellow when the external mark control is enabled
    * FastSwitching # it turns yellow when the total power is sampling with the mark swicthing under its direct control. Note only when sampling is effectively done.
    * Calon # it turn yellow when the noise mark is turned on (non-fast mode) under the control of the Backend. This is not implemented yet. 	
    * ZeroRef # it turns yellow when the backend inputs are connected to the 500hm. It may be yellow during a system temperature measurement.

Auto stow for wind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The telescope will be parked (and the running schedule stopped) if an excessive wind is detected.
