XKa band receiver
*****************
.. sectionauthor:: :ref:`mbuttu`, :ref:`aorlati`

The *XKaBandReceiver* component will manage a dual feed receiver, 
called *Sogliola*, that can operate simultaneously in two bands: 
X and Ka. The receiver is currently installed in the primary focus of
the SRT.

Roach2 based backend

   :ref:`cmigoni`, :ref:`aorlati` 

This backend is a spectropolarimeter capable to exploit multifeed receievers
with large bandwidth and a large number of bins. We are starting the 
integration process. We plan to rely on communication libraries that will
allow us to include future backends more easily. More information could be
found here: :ref:`protocols`.
