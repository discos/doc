Core developers
===============
Leading DISCOS is a small team of core developers, that is people who 
have made and continue to make a significant contribution to 
the project, and have a good understanding not only of the code,
but also the longer-term aims and directions of the project:

    * :ref:`aorlati`
    * :ref:`spoppi`
    * :ref:`gcarboni`


.. _astro_referees:

Astronomical referees
=====================
Astronomers are involved in the various phases of the software design,
implementation and in-antenna testing, in order to exploit their 
specific knowledge and ensure that our system answers to the needs of
the astronomical community:  

    * :ref:`spoppi`
    * :ref:`srighini`

.. _contributors:

Contributors
============
Anyone can be a contributor to DISCOS project. Being a contributor 
simply means that you take an interest in the project and contribute 
in some way, ranging from asking sensible questions (which 
documents the project and provides feedback to developers) through to 
providing new features as components, patches or user's specifications.

If you become a valuable contributor to the project, you may well be 
invited by the :ref:`core developer <core-dev>` to become member of
the team.

Here is the list of DISCOS contributors:
